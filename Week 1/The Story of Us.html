    <h1> The Story of Us Lyrics? </h1>
    <p>I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us <br> How we met and the sparks flew instantly <br> And people would say, "They're the lucky ones" </p>
    <p> 
        I used to know my place was a spot next to you
        <br>Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
        <br>'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
    </p>
    <p> 
        Oh, a simple complication <br>
        Miscommunications lead to fall out <br>
        So many things that I wish you knew <br>
        So many walls up I can't break through
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room <br>
        And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know <br>
        Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah <br>
        I don't know what to say since the twist of fate <br>
        When it all broke down <br>
        And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now <br>
        Next chapter
